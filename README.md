### A cell-cell communication inference approach for spatially resolved transcriptomic data

<img src='https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/SpaTalk/blob/main/img/SpaTalk.png'>

[Spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32505359/) provides the informative details of genes and retained the crucial spatial information, which have enabled the uncovering of spatial architecture in intact organs, shedding light on the spatially resolved [cell-cell communications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32435978/) mediating tissue homeostasis, development and disease. However, inference of cell-cell communications for ST data remains a great challenge. Here, we present SpaTalk, a spatially resolved cell-cell communication inference method relying on the [graph network](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34500471/) and [knowledge graph](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826820300585) to model ligand-receptor-target signaling network between the spatially proximal cells, which were decomposed from the ST data through the non-negative linear model and spatial mapping between single-cell RNA-seq and ST data. SpaTalk is a reliable method that can help scientists uncover the spatially resolved cell-cell communications for either single-cell or spot-based ST data universally, providing new insights into the understanding of spatial cellular dynamics in tissues.

# Install

- install dependent packages `devtools` and [`NNLM`](https://github.com/linxihui/NNLM)

```
> install.packages(pkgs = 'devtools')
> devtools::install_github('linxihui/NNLM')
```

- then install SpaTalk

```
> devtools::install_github('ZJUFanLab/SpaTalk')

# or download the repository as ZIP
> devtools::install_local("/path/to/SpaTalk-main.zip")
```

# Usage
SpaTalk method consists of two components, wherein the first is to dissect the cell-type composition of ST data and the second is to infer the spatially resolved cell-cell communications over the decomposed single-cell ST data. Classification and description of SpaTalk functions are shown in the __[wiki page](https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/SpaTalk/wiki)__ and __[tutorial](https://raw.githack.com/multitalk/awesome-cell-cell-communication/main/method/tutorial.html)__

- ### Cell-type decomposition to reconstruct single-cell ST atlas with known cell types
```
# st_data: A matrix containing counts of st data
# st_meta: A data.frame containing x and y
# sc_data: A matrix containing counts of scRNA-seq data as the reference
# sc_celltype:  A character containing the cell types for scRNA-seq data

> obj <- createSpaTalk(st_data, st_meta, species)
> 
> obj
An object of class SpaTalk 
996 genes across 509 spots (0 lrpair)
> 
> obj <- dec_celltype(obj, sc_data, sc_celltype)
```

- ### Inference of cell-cell communication and ligand-receptor-target network in space
```
# obj: SpaTalk object containg ST and scRNA-seq data
# lrpairs: A data.frame of the system data containing ligand-receptor pairs
# pathways: A data.frame of the system data containing gene-gene interactions and pathways
# celltype_sender
# celltype_receiver

> obj <- find_lr_path(object = obj, lrpairs = lrpairs, pathways = pathways)

> obj <- dec_cci(obj, celltype_sender, celltype_receiver)
```

OR

```
> obj <- dec_cci_all(object)

# score in obj@lrpair is the combined score
> str(obj@lrpair)
